[Live demo](https://visual-argo-workflows-corpulent.vercel.app/)

The goal of this project is to make it easier for everyone on a team to construct and run their own workflows.
Workflows can power CI/CD pipelines, batch data processing, and third-party app integrations.  Depending on the devops support team to provide container images and scripts to be used in execution steps.

This project is fresh and a WIP, with no stable releases yet.  If you have questions please DM me on Twitter https://twitter.com/outermeasure.
